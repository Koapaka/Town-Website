                Vision:<br>TOWN combines a variety of chinese cuisine
                to excite and delight our customers.
                Our vision for the future is to create

                a night out. We aim to bring quality and
                luxury across all aspects of our brand.
                The approach of TOWN is to develop our
                brand with the understanding of both our
                culture and consumer insights. Within our
                vision always lives the promise of inspiring
                creativity, conversation and quality.
                Our audience is a high-end clientele who
                values a dining experience. The age range
                of our customers are from early 30s-60s.
                We would like them to come back for both
                personal dining and events.

                This sesame chicken is crispy chicken pieces tossed 
                in a sweet and savory honey sesame sauce. This version is even 
                better than what you would get at a restaurant!
